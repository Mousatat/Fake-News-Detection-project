Fake News Detection
The Fake News Detection project is a machine learning-based solution to classify news articles into one of four categories - Agree, Disagree, Discuss, or Unrelated. Given a news body and headline, the model will predict the category that the news belongs to.

This project can be useful in combating the spread of misinformation and fake news by automatically identifying and flagging such news articles. It can be used by news organizations, social media platforms, and individuals to ensure that they are not sharing or spreading fake news.
